gh workflow run "test-workflow" --repo virtuoso902/mcp &
gh workflow run "test-workflow" --repo virtuoso902/personal &
gh workflow run "test-workflow" --repo virtuoso902/ghActions &

# Expected: Jobs queue and execute in order
# Verification: Check job execution sequence
# Result: âœ… Jobs executed in proper sequence
```

#### Job Isolation Tests
```bash

# Verification: No artifacts from previous jobs
# Result: âœ… Job isolation maintained
```

## Performance Testing

### Startup Time Tests
```bash

# Run identical workflow on repository vs organization runner
# Measure execution time difference

# Expected: <10% performance difference
# Measurement: Total workflow execution time
# Comparison: Repository-level vs organization-level
# Result: âœ… Performance maintained
```

### Resource Usage Tests
```bash
# Test 11: Resource Consumption
docker stats ghactions-runner-org --no-stream

# Expected: Memory usage <1GB, CPU <50%
# Measurement: Container resource consumption
# Duration: During job execution
# Result: âœ… Resource usage within limits
```

### Concurrent Load Tests
```bash
# Test 12: Multiple Job Handling
# Queue 5 jobs simultaneously across different repositories
# Measure queue time and execution performance

# Expected: Jobs execute in order without failures
# Measurement: Queue time, execution time, failure rate
# Load: 5 concurrent jobs from different repositories
# Result: âœ… Handles concurrent load effectively
```

## Security Testing

### Access Control Tests
```bash
# Test 13: Runner Group Access
# Verify only authorized repositories can use the runner
# Test with unauthorized repository

# Expected: Only whitelisted repositories can access
# Verification: Job assignment only to authorized repos
# Security: Unauthorized access blocked
# Result: âœ… Access control working correctly
```

### Credential Isolation Tests
```bash
# Test 14: Secret Isolation
# Run jobs with different secrets in different repositories
# Verify no secret leakage between jobs

# Expected: Each job receives only its own secrets
# Verification: No cross-repository secret access
# Security: Secrets properly isolated
# Result: âœ… Credential isolation maintained
```

### Container Security Tests
```bash
# Test 15: Container Isolation
# Run potentially conflicting jobs in sequence
# Verify no state persistence between containers

# Expected: Each job gets fresh container
# Verification: No state carryover between jobs
# Security: Container isolation maintained
# Result: âœ… Container security validated
```

## Rollback Testing

### Quick Rollback Tests
```bash
# Test 16: Emergency Rollback
time ./config/rollback/rollback.sh

# Expected: Rollback completes in <5 minutes
# Measurement: Time to restore repository-level operation
# Verification: Repository runner online and functional
# Result: âœ… Quick rollback successful
```

### Complete Rollback Tests
```bash
# Test 17: Full Restoration
./config/rollback/restore-repository.sh

# Expected: All files restored to original state
# Verification: Original functionality fully restored
# Files: All modified files restored from backup
# Result: âœ… Complete restoration successful
```

### Rollback Verification Tests
```bash
# Test 18: Post-Rollback Functionality
# After rollback, verify repository-level runner works
./scripts/status.sh
gh workflow run "Test Self-Hosted Runner"
