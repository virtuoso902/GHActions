# Requirements: Organization-Level Runner

**Purpose:** Define business requirements and success criteria for organization-level runner implementation  
**When to use:** Understanding project goals, acceptance criteria, and success metrics  
**Quick sections:** `## Business Objectives`, `## User Stories`, `## Success Criteria`  
**Size:** ðŸŸ¢ AI-friendly

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goal
Implement a single GitHub Actions self-hosted runner that can serve multiple repositories in the `virtuoso902` organization, eliminating the current repository-level limitation.

### Secondary Goals
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce infrastructure overhead by sharing resources across repositories
- **Operational Simplicity**: Centralize runner management and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Enable easy addition of new repositories without infrastructure changes
- **Security**: Maintain isolation and security through runner groups

## User Stories

### As a Repository Maintainer
- **I want** my repository workflows to run on self-hosted runners **so that** I can save GitHub Actions minutes
- **I want** to not worry about runner availability **so that** I can focus on development
- **I want** consistent runner performance **so that** my CI/CD pipelines are reliable

### As a System Administrator
- **I want** one runner to serve multiple repositories **so that** I reduce management overhead
- **I want** centralized configuration **so that** updates are applied consistently
- **I want** easy rollback capability **so that** I can quickly revert problematic changes

### As a Developer
- **I want** workflows to work the same across all repositories **so that** I have consistent experience
- **I want** minimal workflow changes **so that** existing CI/CD continues to work
- **I want** clear documentation **so that** I can understand how to use the runner

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **Single Runner Registration**: Runner registers at organization level (`virtuoso902`)
- [ ] **Multi-Repository Support**: All target repositories can use the same runner
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue to work with minimal changes
- [ ] **Security Isolation**: Jobs from different repositories are properly isolated

### Target Repositories
- [ ] **coach**: NoCapLife Coach workflows run successfully
- [ ] **mcp**: Universal MCP Server Hub workflows run successfully  
- [ ] **personal**: Personal projects workflows run successfully
- [ ] **ghActions**: GitHub Actions runner workflows run successfully

### Operational Requirements
- [ ] **Easy Rollback**: Can revert to repository-level runner within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Single configuration file controls all settings
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Clear visibility into runner status and job distribution
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete guides for expansion to new repositories

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- âœ… **Runner Online**: Organization-level runner shows as online in GitHub
- âœ… **Multi-Repository Jobs**: All 4 target repositories can execute jobs
- âœ… **Job Isolation**: No cross-repository contamination or security issues
- âœ… **Performance**: Job execution time matches or improves current performance

### Operational Success
- âœ… **Zero Downtime**: Implementation with no service interruption
- âœ… **Quick Rollback**: Rollback procedures tested and validated
- âœ… **Clear Monitoring**: Status and health monitoring in place
- âœ… **Documentation**: All procedures documented and tested

### Business Success
- âœ… **Cost Reduction**: Single runner reduces infrastructure costs
- âœ… **Simplified Management**: One place to manage all runner operations
- âœ… **Scalability**: New repositories can be added without infrastructure changes
- âœ… **Team Adoption**: Development teams can use the runner effectively

## Scope Boundaries

### Included in This Implementation
- Organization-level runner registration and configuration
- Multi-repository workflow support
- Runner groups for access control
- Rollback procedures and documentation
- Testing across all target repositories

### Excluded from This Implementation
- Multiple runner instances (scaling handled separately)
- Advanced runner group configurations
- Workflow optimization or performance tuning
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Custom runner images or specialized configurations

## Priority Levels

### High Priority (Must Have)
- Single runner serving all target repositories
- Secure job isolation between repositories
- Complete rollback capability
- Documentation for expansion

### Medium Priority (Should Have)  
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Automated health checks
- Enhanced security configurations
- Integration testing automation

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- Advanced runner group strategies
- Custom labels and runner selection
- Integration with external tools
- Performance optimization features

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Breaking existing workflows**: Mitigation through thorough testing and rollback procedures
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Mitigation through proper runner group configuration and testing

### Medium Risk
- **Performance degradation**: Mitigation through monitoring and performance testing
- **Configuration complexity**: Mitigation through clear documentation and simple configuration

### Low Risk
- **Team adoption issues**: Mitigation through comprehensive documentation and training
- **Future scaling challenges**: Mitigation through designed-for-growth architecture
