- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly longer job startup time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No caching between jobs

### Decision 4: OAuth Token Requirements
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Status:** Approved  
**Decision:** Require admin:org scope for organization-level runner

**Context:**
- Organization-level runner needs organization permissions
- Current token has repo scope only
- Need to balance security with functionality

**Options Considered:**
1. **admin:org Scope** (Selected)
   - Full organization access
   - Can manage runner groups
   - Required for organization runners

2. **Minimal Scopes**
   - Limited permissions
   - Reduced security risk
   - Insufficient for organization runners

3. **Repository-Specific Tokens**
   - Per-repository authentication
   - Complex token management
   - Doesn't support organization runners

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Functionality**: Required for organization-level registration
- **Management**: Enables runner group management
- **Future-Ready**: Supports advanced features
- **Security**: OAuth token is already secure

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Enables organization-level functionality
- ‚úÖ Supports advanced runner management
- ‚úÖ Future-ready for enhancements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires token scope update
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher privilege level

## Implementation Decisions

### Decision 5: Backward Compatibility Strategy
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Status:** Approved  
**Decision:** Maintain backward compatibility with repository-level configuration

**Context:**
- Need to support both organization and repository modes
- Existing configuration should continue to work
- Enable gradual migration

**Options Considered:**
1. **Dual Mode Support** (Selected)
   - Support both organization and repository
   - Automatic fallback logic
   - Gradual migration

2. **Organization Only**
   - Clean implementation
   - No backward compatibility
   - Requires immediate migration

3. **Repository Only**
